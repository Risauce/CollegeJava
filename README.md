# CollegeJava
Repository for university Java projects.
Contains all of my old Java projects from CSCI132 and CSCI232. These projects focus mainly on simple and Advanced Data structures including linked lists, stacks, heaps, trees and hash tables. There is also a small focus on Java Object Oriented design, along with recursion, and sorting methods. 

This Repo is mostly for use in recording past works and compiling knowledge learned throughout my time at Montana State University.
